### Reflection 

  ### Richard's Reflection 
- This is Jacob and mine's first time working with react and it was a really great project to start off on, I was suprisingly chill throughout all of it. It seems like most of the work I used to spend a ton of time on, React takes that workload off. What wass most challenging for me was really figuring out Cypress I spent days combing though the testing lession to get some type of a grasp on it, but I eventually figured it out by trial and error. 

- Jacob has been an amazing project partner. He really killed it with the UI and the design of ths site, I really enjoyed working on paired programming with him, and even when we decided to split up and tackle some of the work by divide and conquer, I know that I for sure learned a lot from him and his styles.

- Looking back some of the challenges I think we had togethere was just getting used to React, it is are first time messing around with it so starting it we were just getting our barings, but after a few days we were really able to implement everything we learned from this point from API calls, to iterating over arrays to where some things were we were brezing through. My biggest challenge was learning ```Switch``` statements, and how to use them for differnet paths
